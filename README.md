# River-Bridge
It's My First Final Project of Algorithm Design Course.

Explaining the Project :<br />

There is a River.There are 5 cities on each side of the river.<br />
At the top of the river, the cities are listed in order.<br />
But at the bottom of the river, the cities come in the order that the user enters.<br />
The program must build the largest number of bridges between cities of the same number.<br />
Note: There must be only one bridge for each city and the bridges should not intersect.<br />
bonus grade: Show the Result Graphical.<br />

I use python and Pygame Library for the Project :)
